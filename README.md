# Facial-recognition-project
facial recognition project completed as part of "video analytics and machine learning" module

This project gave me a chance to gain an understanding in computer vision with an empasis on machine learning. I got the chance to run different learning methods
including, SVM, KNN and NN. I also got the chance to use different facial feature extractors. To run any of the models, open the file "X Model" and choose an appropriate
learning method and feature extractor. The implementation of the model is in the file "SVMImplementation". This project I found difficult as I was completing a group 
assignment by myself, however I believe that it was because of this that I gained a better understanding of the module as a whole
